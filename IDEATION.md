# 📘 Ideation Document — Library Lite

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Most existing library management systems are either outdated, hard to use, or limited to institutional use.  
Students and readers often struggle to find, review, and discuss books on a single unified platform.  
There’s a gap between **book discovery**, **user interaction**, and **community-driven reviews** — especially in academic settings.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

**Library Lite** will be a modern web-based platform that bridges this gap by combining a digital library system with social interaction features.  
It will allow users to:

- Browse and search for books easily.  
- Create accounts and manage profiles.  
- Write reviews and share thoughts on books.  
- Create and interact with posts within a reading community.  
- Access a visually clean and mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS.  

Library Lite aims to make library access **simple, social, and smart**.
